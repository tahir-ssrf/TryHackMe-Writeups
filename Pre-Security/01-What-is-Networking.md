## What I learned
A network is a group of devices connected to share data and resources.

### Types of networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Home/office network.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Connects networks over large distances (Internet).
- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Personal devices (Bluetooth/hotspot).

### Core concepts
- **IP address:** Logical address of a device on a network.
- **Router:** Connects different networks (LAN ↔ Internet).
- **Switch:** Connects devices inside the same LAN.
- **Packets:** Data is broken into small pieces to travel across the network.

## Why this matters for pentesting
Pentesting starts with understanding how devices communicate. Later when you use tools like Nmap, traffic, ports, and IPs will make sense because networking basics are clear.
