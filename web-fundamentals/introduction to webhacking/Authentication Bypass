**Duration:** 50 minutes  

## 📋 What I Learned (Simple Explanation)  
Authentication = Login system. Bypass = Get in without password. Here's exactly how:



## Core Concepts (Anyone Can Understand)  

### 1. Username Guessing (Task 2)  
**The Trick:** Websites tell you if username exists  
Try "admin" → "Wrong password" = ADMIN EXISTS! 🎯
Try "xyz123" → "No user found" = DOESN'T EXIST ❌


**Why it works:** Lazy error messages give away valid usernames  

### 2. Password Guessing (Task 3)  
**The Method:** Computer tries 1000s passwords fast  
Tool: Hydra (like super-fast typing robot)
Passwords: admin, 123456, password123, rockyou.txt list

**Smart way:** Go slow to avoid lockout  

### 3. Broken Login Logic (Task 4)  
**The Bug:** Website doesn't check properly  
Normal: username=admin&password=secret123
Broken: username=admin&password= (EMPTY!) → LOGS IN! 😱

**Common mistakes:** 
- Empty password works
- Clicks "Login" button = auto login  
- Forgets to check password field  

### 4. Cookie Tricks (Task 5)  
**What are cookies?** Tiny notes browser keeps  
Normal cookie: user=john; admin=false
Hacked cookie: user=john; admin=true → ADMIN ACCESS! 🏆


**How:** Browser extension changes cookie value

## 🧠 Key Takeaways (Super Simple)  
Error messages = username list

Robots guess passwords

Empty fields sometimes work

Change cookies = become admin



**Real job value:** Every website has these bugs. Fix them = security job!

## 🔍 Why Hackers Love This  
Find login → Guess username → Try tricks → Become admin
5 minutes → Full website control

**Leads to:** Stealing data, changing passwords, ransomware  

**Next Room:** IDOR
